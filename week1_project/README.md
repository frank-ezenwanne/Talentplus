## Details from Frank

Okay, so this project has 2 parts: The backend (displaytalent) and the frontend dt_frontend. The settings for containerization by Docker has been included.

Just start up docker, run docker-compose up in ya terminal. Relax..wait for the dependencies to install... The build and containers would be up and running.

NB: You might have to wait a bit for the react scripts to run. Once you see...successfully compiled... You can now view dt_frontend in the browser... you are good to go at that point. Anything before that, you will not be able to view the react frontend.

There is one url for fetching 'TALENT PLUS' and 2 bonus urls:one for creating new company and the other for listing all the available urls (localhost:8000/api).

NB: A record with name field 'TALENT PLUS' was initially created.
